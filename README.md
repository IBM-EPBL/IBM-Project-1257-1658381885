**Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction üçÄ**

**Farmer's friendüòç**
     

**Introduction :**

Fertilizer Recommentation system for disease Prediction is a simple ML and DL based website which recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use and the diseases caught by your crops when a leaf image of the crop is given as an input.

**Scope of the project :**

In India, The Agriculture industry is extremely vital and crucial for economic and social development and jobs. In India, the agricultural sector provides a living for almost 48% of the population. As per the 2019-2020 economic survey, an Indian farmer's median wage in 16 states is Rupees 2500. Most of the Indian population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture gives an opportunity of employment to the village people to develop a country like India on large scale and give a push in the economic sector. The majority of farmers face the problem of planting an inappropriate crop for their land based on a conventional or non-scientific approach. This is a challenging task for a country like India, where agriculture feeds approximately 42% of the population. And the outcomes for the farmer of choosing the wrong crop for land is moving towards metro city for livelihoods, suicide, quitting the agriculture and give land on lease to industrialist or use for the non-agriculture purpose. The outcome of wrong crop selection is less yield and less profit.

**Problem Statement :**

To detect diseases that the crop has been affected with and suggest suitable fertilizers for the same.

**Problem Solution :**

The solution to the problem is Machine learning, which is one of the applications of Artificial Intelligence, is being used to implement the proposed system. Crop recommendation is going to recommend you the best crop you can grow in your land as per the soil nutrition value and along with as per the climate in that region. And recommending the best fertilizer for every particular crop is also a challenging task.
